What does it do?
Due to technology expanding rapidly, cybersecurity is a growing field that will continue to grow until such time. New devices are being created and will be connected to the internet using 5G. Most devices will be vulnerable to attacks and that’s why machine learning is also growing in the cybersecurity field in hopes to minimise vulnerabilities in technology.
The most common attack vectors in cybersecurity are already regulated with machine learning, specifically when it comes to financial assets. Hackers will continue to target health and financial organisations due to their high value and worth. These organisation sectors will always work to be the most secure and will implement strategies to prevent attacks and protect its customers.
The rise of ransomware has costed organisations billions of dollars every single year and machine learning may not be able to prevent every attack vector. Quantum computers are designed to calculate complex algorithms that non traditional computers can’t. Quantum computers will be able to break cryptography and weaken ones that can’t be broken. This may be possible within the next three years but only to people and organisations who can afford a quantum computer due to how expensive the system costs and to maintain it.
